    <h2 class="content-text">The mountains a place to bring serenity to your mind    </h2>
    <p class="content-text">Mountain scenery also has a power over the mind. It is a great source of well-being, just like any natural landscape. Moreover, we can often notice that when our body is strengthened, our morale also improves. The pure mountain air also has a strong impact on our state of mind, which in turn becomes more Zen. And this is what many institutes located at altitude have also noticed. In addition, their treatments, which often use local spring water, increase these benefits by relieving tension even more effectively and eliminating toxins quickly. In such an environment, you also get more light. This natural source of vitamin D is essential for good health. </p><br/>
    <p class="content-text">This also has an impact on your biological clock, which will regulate itself much more easily. You will thus regain a healthy internal balance which contributes considerably to calming you down. This will increase your energy and vitality for a long time to come! Far from the crowds that often crowd the beaches, you can find the calm your mind needs at the top of the mountains.</p><br/>
    <p class="content-text">When we reconnect with the natural space of the mountains, we also reconnect with sensations that go back to our childhood. A bath of youth perpetually renewed by the pleasure of (re)discovering the elements, the territories, their fauna and their flora... Going to the mountains also means accepting the rhythm of nature and the rules it imposes. It means respecting and blending in with the environment, and taking full advantage of the magnificent landscapes, whatever we do. </p><br/>
